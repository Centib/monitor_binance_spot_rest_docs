# monitor\_binance\_spot\_rest\_docs

A simple monitoring tool that checks for changes in Binance Spot REST API documentation (`rest-api.md`) and logs differences over time.
Optionally, it can send change notifications to a Discord channel via webhook.

---

## Features

* Detects changes in [`rest-api.md`](https://github.com/binance/binance-spot-api-docs/blob/master/rest-api.md)
* Logs changes in standard **git diff** format (easy to read in VS Code or any diff viewer)
* Optional Discord notifications when changes are detected
* Minimal dependencies (just `git`, `bash`, `curl`, `python3`)

---

## How It Works

On each run, the script:

1. Fetches the latest Binance Spot REST API docs.
2. Compares `rest-api.md` against the latest `origin/master`.
3. Logs whether changes were detected into `changes.diff`.
4. Optionally sends messages to Discord if a webhook is configured.
5. Updates the local copy of `rest-api.md` for the next run.

## Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/monitor_binance_spot_rest_docs.git
cd monitor_binance_spot_rest_docs
chmod +x monitor.sh
```

---

## Usage

Run the script manually:

```bash
./monitor.sh
```

Output will be stored in `changes.diff` (next to the repo).

---

## Environment

The script optionally uses a Discord webhook to send notifications:

* **Environment variable:**
  `MONITOR_BINANCE_SPOT_REST_DOCS_DISCORD_WEBHOOK`
  Set this to your Discord Webhook URL if you want notifications.

* **Example:**

  ```bash
  export MONITOR_BINANCE_SPOT_REST_DOCS_DISCORD_WEBHOOK="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/XXXX/XXXX"
  ```

* **Persistence:**
  To make the variable available in every session, add it to your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`):

  ```bash
  echo 'export MONITOR_BINANCE_SPOT_REST_DOCS_DISCORD_WEBHOOK="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/XXXX/XXXX"' >> ~/.bashrc
  source ~/.bashrc
  ```

* **OS Compatibility:**
  Tested on Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS). Requires:

  * `bash`
  * `git`
  * `curl` (only if using Discord notifications)
  * `python3` (for JSON escaping of messages)

---

## Automation

You can run this script on a schedule with **cron**:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Example (run every day at 10:00):

```
0 10 * * * /path/to/monitor_binance_spot_rest_docs/monitor.sh
```

Logs will continue to append to `changes.diff`.

## Example Output

When no changes:

```

```

When changes detected:
